Creating a Pump Maze Game with embedded secrets from CA (Certificate Authority) and encrypted hints, as well as large rewards for players, is an exciting concept. This game would likely combine puzzle-solving, cryptography, and a reward system, possibly using blockchain or cryptocurrency. Hereâ€™s a basic framework of how you could implement this idea into a practical project.

from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import base64

def decrypt_ciphertext(ciphertext, key):
    # Decrypt using AES CBC mode
    cipher = AES.new(key.encode(), AES.MODE_CBC, iv=b'1234567890123456')
    decrypted = cipher.decrypt(base64.b64decode(ciphertext))
    return decrypted.strip().decode('utf-8')

# Ciphertext and Key
ciphertext = 'U2FsdGVkX1+g5vtx/xxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
key = 'SecretKey123456'  # Key obtained by the player

# Decrypt
decrypted_message = decrypt_ciphertext(ciphertext, key)
print("Decrypted message:", decrypted_message)
